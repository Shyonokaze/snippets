\subsection{Image Acquisition}

All images were recorded using an Olympus BX-61 equipped with
an automated Prior H138 stage and a SpotRT Slider CCD camera.
The \code{analySIS Five Pro} image processing software controls
the three stage axes (including focus) and the camera. In order
to obtain the most reproducible contrast in the images, the
camera was adjusted to record 800x600 pixel image with 4096
gray levels per pixel.

Images were recorded with a 10X (0.30 NA) objective.  A small
variation in focus was observed across the field, so an
``extended focus'' image was computed at each position from a
stack of 11 images recorded over $\pm$ 30 \textmu m using our
custom automation package.

The entire cross-section was imaged using stage automation
and automated focus determination and computation of the
extended focus image at each point. This resulted an a series
of 60 images that were stored as an image file series of TIF
images with all required parameters stored in the custom
TIF header.
