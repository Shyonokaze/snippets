\subsection{SEM Imaging}

To get the highest resolution images that the lab can produce,
field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)images were
recorded at 5 and 15 kV and a working distance of 6 mm using the FEI
Sirion 400NC FE-SEM (S/N D5557). The contrast was higher at 5 kV,
but resolution was better at 15 kV, so measurements were performed
on the 15 kV images.

Images were recorded in ``ultra-high resolution'' (UHR) mode
using the ``through the lens detector" (TLD)
biased to 50 V to collect both secondary and backscattered electrons.
Images were collected using the microscope's ``Extra High Definition''
(XHD) mode resulting in a 1296x968 pixel image with 256 gray levels.
Image acquisition was controlled by the ``Analysis-Five'' software,
which stores all relevant information in the custom file header of
the uncompressed TIFF images that automatically are stored to disk.
