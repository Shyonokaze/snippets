\subsection{Laminate Preparation for SEM}

A small square of laminate was cut from the roll and
mounted over a 1.5 in hole in a piece of card stock.
The stretched laminate was held in place with adhesive
tape.

A small square, just smaller than the 1 in diameter SEM
stub, was cut from a carbon adhesive tab and was mounted
on a pre-cleaned Al SEM stub. The adhesive square was pushed
up under the bottom of theexposed laminate film, fastening the
laminate to the adhesive. The excess laminate was trimmed from
around the edge with a razor blade. Conductive silver traces
were painted from the edge of the top surface of the
laminate to the surface of the Al SEM stub.

To render the surface conductive, a semi-thin Pt
layer was sputtered (60 sec) onto the surface.
