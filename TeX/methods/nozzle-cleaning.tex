\subsection{Cleaning}

The small segment from segment ``A'' of the
nozzle plate was soaked for 4 hrs in a dilute
solution of Mr Clean with gentle intermittent 
rocking. The cleaned nozzle plate was washed with
a stream of deionized water until no bubbles were
observed and then with three changes of acetone
and three changes of 3A alcohol. The cleaned
nozzle plate was air-dried prior to mounting
for SEM.
