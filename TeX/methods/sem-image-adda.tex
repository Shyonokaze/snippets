\subsection{SEM Backscattered Electron Imaging}

Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)images were
recorded at 5 kV and a working distance of 5 mm using the FEI
Sirion 400NC FE-SEM (S/N D5557). Images were collected in the
``UHR'' mode with the ``through-the lens detector'' biased to
collect backscattered electrons.

Images with 4096 gray levels were recorded using the
microscope's external scan control using an Olympus-SIS ADDA-II
digital scan generator. Image acquisition was controlled
by an external PC using the Olympus-SIS ``Analysis-Five''
software. All relevant information is stored in the
custom file header of the uncompressed TIFF images that
are stored to disk. The lens hysteresis was corrected
by cycling the lens through a prescribed current sequence
using the electronic remote interface and focusing with the
stage height control.

Our image collection and analysis procedure was described
in detail by Minter and Swanson\footnote{John Minter and Craig
Swanson, ``Comparison of two methods for gray level threshold
selection for STREAM nozzle diameter measurement, RAN 345567B,
December 9, 2010.}. Images were collected from nozzles
in the regions specified in Table~\ref{tab:SampleInfo}.
