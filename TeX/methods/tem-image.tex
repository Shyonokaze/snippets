\subsection{TEM Imaging}

The specimen was imaged at 200 kV in a FEI model CM20UT
transmission electron microscope with a lanthanum hexaboride
cathode. The microscope has the stable ``ultra-twin'' lens and
a ``super-twin'' pole-piece to provide sufficient space for an
EDAX RT X-Ray energy dispersive spectroscopy detector with an
ultra-thin window.

Images were recorded on a Gatan Ultra-Scan (Model 894) CCD
camera controlled by the Digital Micrograph software.
