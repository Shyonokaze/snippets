\subsection{Cryo-ultramicrotomy}

Rob surrounded the decal and electrode with aqueous
cryo-adhesive and cooled the sample
to -60\degree C in an Leica Ultracut FCS cryo-chamber
attached to a Leica Ultra-Cut S ultramicrotome. Rob
cut 100 nm thick sections on a Diatome cryo-diamond
knife. He retrieved the sections from the knife surface
using a drop of 2.1M sucrose on a loop, and transferred
the sections to the surface of a C-coated poly(vinyl
formal) support film mounted on a 2x1 mm slot in a Cu
TEM grid. The sucrose was removed by 3 successive washings
on the surface of a droplet of deionized water on a
piece of Parafilm. The sections were dried thoroughly
prior to microscopy.
